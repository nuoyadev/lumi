**Post on Twitter/X and Instagram automatically. No API fees. No manual work. Just results.**

Built by [@nuoyadev](https://github.com/nuoyadev) — Because building is more important than posting about building.

## What is Lumi?

**Lumi** is an AI-powered social media autopilot that runs silently in the background and posts for you every single day, while you focus on what actually matters: building.

It uses LLMs (Claude / GPT-4) to generate platform-native content from your ideas, projects, and GitHub activity, then uses Playwright to post directly via the browser — completely free, no API keys required for posting.

```
Your projects → Lumi AI → Twitter/X post ✓
                        → Instagram caption ✓
                        → Scheduled & done ✓
```
